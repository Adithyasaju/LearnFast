About LearnFast
LearnFast is a conceptual online platform designed to help individuals acquire new skills quickly and efficiently. This website serves as its introductory online presence, showcasing its mission, course offerings (specifically Data Analytics), and providing a way for users to register and contact the platform.

Features
Homepage (index.html): Introduces LearnFast with a mission statement, key features, and a call to action.

Course Details Page (course.html): Provides detailed information about a specific course (Data Analytics Masterclass), including learning objectives, target audience, and highlights.

Registration Page (register.html): A simple form for users to register for a course, collecting basic personal and course selection details.

Confirmation Page (confirmation.html): A "Thank You" message displayed after a user submits the registration form.

About Us & Contact Page (about.html): Details about the LearnFast philosophy, mission, and various contact methods (email, phone, address).

Consistent Navigation: A top navigation bar is included on all pages for easy site traversal.

Simple CSS Styling: All styling is done using internal CSS within each HTML file, ensuring a consistent look and feel across the site.

Basic Responsiveness: The layout adapts reasonably well to different screen sizes (e.g., mobile, tablet, desktop).

File Structure
The project consists of the following HTML files in the root directory:

├── index.html
├── course.html
├── register.html
├── confirmation.html
└── about.html

index.html: The main landing page.

course.html: Details about the Data Analytics course.

register.html: The user registration form.

confirmation.html: The "Thank You" page displayed after registration.

about.html: Information about LearnFast and contact details.

How to Run
Since this is a static HTML/CSS website, you don't need any special setup or server.

Download/Clone: Download all the HTML files (index.html, course.html, register.html, confirmation.html, about.html) into a single folder on your computer.

Open in Browser: Simply open index.html (or any other .html file) directly in your web browser. You can do this by double-clicking the file.

The navigation links will allow you to move between the different pages.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For structuring the web content.

CSS3: For styling the elements and providing responsiveness.

Future Improvements
External CSS: Move all CSS into a single external stylesheet (style.css) to avoid code repetition and make maintenance easier.

JavaScript Interactivity:

Add client-side form validation for a better user experience on register.html.

Implement dynamic content loading or basic animations.

Full Responsiveness: Enhance the responsive design with more specific media queries for various device sizes.

More Courses: Expand the course.html to either list multiple courses or use a templating system for different course details.

Backend Integration: For actual registration and data storage, a backend (e.g., Node.js, Python, PHP) would be required to process form submissions.

Modern CSS Framework: Consider using a framework like Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap for faster and more robust styling.

Favicon: Add a favicon to appear in browser tabs.

Accessibility: Improve accessibility features (e.g., ARIA attributes, better semantic HTML).
